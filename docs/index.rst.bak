PyNTA: Python Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis
=============================================

Nanoparticle tracking analysis refers to a technique used for characterizing small objects optically. The base principle
is that by following the movement of nanoparticles over time, it is possible to calculate their diffusion properties and
thus derive their size.

PyNTA aims at bridging the gap between experiments and results by combining data acquisition and analysis in one simple
to use program.

PyNTA is shipped as a package that can be installed into a virtual environment with the use of pip. It can be both
triggered with a built in function or can be included into larger projects.

Installing
----------
The best place to look for the code of the program is the repository at
`https://github.com/nanoepics/pynta <https://github.com/nanoepics/pynta>`_. In short, if you want to install PyNTA you
can run the following command::

    pip install git+https://github.com/nanoepics/pynta

If you need further assistance with the installation of the code, please check :ref:`installing`.

Start the program
-----------------
After installing, the program can be started from the command line by running the following:

    python -m pynta -c config.yml

Remember that config.yml needs to exist. To create your own configuration file, you can start with the example provided
in the `examples folder <https://github.com/nanoepics/pynta/tree/master/examples>`_. Once the program starts, it will
look like the following:

Contributing to the Program
---------------------------
The program is open source and therefore you can modify it in any way that you see fit. You have to remember that the
code was written with a specific experiment in mind and therefore it may not fulfill or the requirements of more
advanced imaging software.

However the design of the program is such that would allow its expansion to meet future needs. In case you are wondering
how the code can be improved you can start by reading :ref:`improving`, or directly submerge yourself in the
documentation of the different classes :ref:`PyNTA`.

If you want to start right away to improve the code, you can always look at the :ref:`todo`.

This program was developed by Aquiles Carattino with the support of funding from NWO, The Netherlands Scientific
Organization, under a Vici grant from Prof. Allard Mosk. This work was carried on at Utrecht University in the months
between June 2018 and December 2018.
